# Bars log

My goal is to generate abstract art based on a lines/bars like in a set of "brush strokes".


## STEP ONE:

Simply draw rectangles for "bruch strokes".

## STEP TWO:

Play with angles... Let us start with 0/90 to begin with, as this will look more like the grid I want to get to.

## STEP THREE:

Play with angles and dimensions... I wanted to see if this can express interesting movement through superposition.
